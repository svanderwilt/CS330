Computational Graphics and Visualization

I approach designing software by first making sure that I understand the requirements.  If I need any clarification on the requirements I make sure to get them before starting.  Once I fully understand the requirements, I then break them up into smaller testable parts.  I'm then able to start coding and testing.  I feel that this approach will work well for me in the future as projects get bigger and bigger.

My approach for developing this program was to learn as much as I could about OpenGL and translate that knowledge into the assignment.  The school provided a really good tutorial that contained started code and I was able to utilize that and build upon it to create my final scene.  My approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones by focusing on one aspect of the scene and apply the newly learned features such as drawing, shading, texturing, and lighting in individual steps and then applying those techniques to the entire scene. 

This course gave me a lot of information about computational graphics and visualizations that I really had no idea about prior to the class starting.  I'm not sure if I'll use these techniques in my career path, but I'll probably use them in personal projects and the coding I did in C++ really helped solidify my skills with that language.
